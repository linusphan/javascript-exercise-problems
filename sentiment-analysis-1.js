input
  - some text as argument

result
  - logs some information about whether the text has a
    positive, negative, or neutral sentiment

rules
  - sentiment is positive if difference is > 0
  - sentiment is negative if difference is < 0
  - sentiment is neutral if difference is 0

data structure
  - object to store counts

algorithm
  - initialize counts object
    { positive: 0, negative: 0 }
  - initialize positive words used array
  - initialize negative words used array
  - count the positive and negative words in our text
    - iterate through each line
      - split('\n')
      - forEach
        - iterate through each word in line
          - forEach
            - if postiveWords array includes word
                count.positive += 1
            - if negativeWords array includes word
                count.negative -= 1
    - compute a sentiment score as the difference
        var difference = count.positive - count.negative
  - return based on difference

      Positive sentiments: fortune, dream, respect, love, resolution
